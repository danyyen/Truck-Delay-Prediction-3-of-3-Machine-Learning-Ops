# E2E Part 3
## Overview
The project addresses a critical challenge faced by the logistics industry. Delayed truck shipments not only result in increased operational costs but also impact customer satisfaction. Timely delivery of goods is essential to meet customer expectations and maintain the competitiveness of logistics companies.
By accurately predicting truck delays, logistics companies can:
Improve operational efficiency by allocating resources more effectively
Enhance customer satisfaction by providing more reliable delivery schedules
Optimize route planning to reduce delays caused by traffic or adverse weather conditions
Reduce costs associated with delayed shipments, such as penalties or compensation to customers

In Part 1, I laid the groundwork by utilizing PostgreSQL and MySQL in AWS RDS for data storage, setting up an AWS Sagemaker Notebook, performing data retrieval, conducting exploratory data analysis, and creating feature groups with Hopsworks. 

In Part 2, I focused on building a machine learning pipeline by retrieving data from the feature store, performing train-validation-test split, one-hot encoding, scaling numerical features, experimenting with logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost models, and deploying a Streamlit application on AWS.

Building upon the groundwork laid in Parts 1 and 2, this part implements model monitoring to detect data and model drift, integrates CI/CD practices for automated model deployment, and leverages Amazon SageMaker Pipelines for streamlined orchestration of the machine learning workflow. The aim is to ensure the reliability, scalability, and efficiency of the deployed model in real-world logistics scenarios.

# Local Execution Instructions

# Python version 3.10

To create a virtual environment and install requirements in Python 3.10 on different operating systems, follow the instructions below:

### For Windows:

Open the Command Prompt by pressing Win + R, typing "cmd", and pressing Enter.

Change the directory to the desired location for your project:


`cd C:\path\to\project`

Create a new virtual environment using the venv module:


`python -m venv myenv`

Activate the virtual environment:

`myenv\Scripts\activate`


Install the project requirements using pip:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### For Linux/Mac:
Open a terminal.

Change the directory to the desired location for your project:

`cd /path/to/project`

Create a new virtual environment using the venv module:

`python3.10 -m venv myenv`


Activate the virtual environment:

`source myenv/bin/activate`

Install the project requirements using pip:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

These instructions assume you have Python 3.10 installed and added to your system's PATH variable.

## Execution Instructions if Multiple Python Versions Installed

If you have multiple Python versions installed on your system, you can use the Python Launcher to create a virtual environment with Python 3.10. Specify the version using the -p or --python flag. Follow the instructions below:

For Windows:
Open the Command Prompt by pressing Win + R, typing "cmd", and pressing Enter.

Change the directory to the desired location for your project:

`cd C:\path\to\project`

Create a new virtual environment using the Python Launcher:

`py -3.10 -m venv myenv`

Note: Replace myenv with your desired virtual environment name.

Activate the virtual environment:

`
myenv\Scripts\activate
`

Install the project requirements using pip:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


### For Linux/Mac:
Open a terminal.

Change the directory to the desired location for your project:

`cd /path/to/project
`
Create a new virtual environment using the Python Launcher:


`python3.10 -m venv myenv`


Note: Replace myenv with your desired virtual environment name.

Activate the virtual environment:

By specifying the version using py -3.10 or python3.10, you can ensure that the virtual environment is created using Python 3.10 specifically, even if you have other Python versions installed.



## Run streamlit application

`streamlit run app.py`



# Streamlit Application Deployment on AWS EC2

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying a Streamlit application on an AWS EC2 instance. 

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- Basic knowledge of AWS EC2, SSH, and Streamlit


## Deployment Steps

### 1. Launching EC2 Instance

- Launch an EC2 instance on AWS with the following specifications:
  - Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
  - Instance Type: t2.medium (or your preferred type)
  - Security Group: Allow inbound traffic on port 8501 for Streamlit

- Create and download a PEM key for SSH access to the EC2 instance.

- Disable Inheritance and Restrict Access on PEM key For Windows Users:
    - Locate the downloaded PEM key file (e.g., your-key.pem) using File Explorer.

    - Right-click on the PEM key file and select "Properties."

    - In the "Properties" window, go to the "Security" tab.

    - Click on the "Advanced" button.

    - In the "Advanced Security Settings" window, you'll see an "Inheritance" section. Click on the "Disable inheritance" button.

    - A dialog box will appear; choose the option "Remove all inherited permissions from this object" and click "Convert inherited permissions into explicit permissions on this object."

    - Once inheritance is disabled, you will see a list of users/groups with permissions. Remove permissions for all users except for the user account you are using (typically an administrator account).

    - Click "Apply" and then "OK" to save the changes.


### 2. Accessing EC2 Instance

1. Use the following SSH command to connect to your EC2 instance:
  ```
  ssh -i "your-key.pem" ubuntu@your-ec2-instance-public-ip
  ```

2. Gain superuser access by running: `sudo su`

3. Updating and Verifying Python
  - Update the EC2 instance with the latest packages:
    `apt update`

  - Verify Python installation:
    `python3 --version`

4. Installing Python Packages
`apt install python3-pip`

5. Transferring Files to EC2
    Use SCP to transfer your Streamlit application code to the EC2 instance:

    ```scp -i "your-key.pem" -r path/to/your/app ubuntu@your-ec2-instance-public-ip:/path/to/remote/location```

6. Setting Up Streamlit Application
    Change the working directory to the deployment files location:

    `cd /path/to/remote/location`

    Install dependencies from your requirements file:

    `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

7. Running the Streamlit Application
    Test your Streamlit application (Use external link):
    `streamlit run app.py`


    For a permanent run, use nohup:
    `nohup streamlit run app.py`

8. Cleanup and Termination
To terminate the nohup process:
  - `sudo su`
  - `ps -df`
  - `kill {process id}`
